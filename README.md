# Space Invaders Project
This is just a simple game created in the essence of arcade games like Space Invaders.


## Description

This is my first ever pygame and so far the most fun project I have created with python. Based on instructions from Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Windows, etc, any operating system that can run .exe files

### Installing

* Download the whole folder, containing the data sub-folder, high-score.txt file and the .exe itself.

### Executing program

* Just run the .exe file and the game should start.



## Help

Edit the high-score.txt file to change the high-score value displayed.
The score value on the top-left is your current session's score.
press 'q' to quit.
